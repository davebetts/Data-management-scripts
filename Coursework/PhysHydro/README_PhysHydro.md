# Homework and inclass activities for Physical Hydrology (USU - D.Tarboton)

## Homework scripts
The homework scripts use the following naming convention: my name (betts_), class (physhydro_), homework (hw), and assignment number (e.g. "betts_physhyd_hw1.r" for assignment #1).

These files need editing to make sure the descriptions are complete and to see if there are useful sections of code to extract to create generalizable tools.

## Rwork.r
Provided by D.Tarboton.  Has a good and simple example of how to address water years. More elements need to be indexed from this file.  Some elements were adapted to the scripts written by davebetts for the homework and other activities.
