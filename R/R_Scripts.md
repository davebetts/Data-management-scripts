Majority of the files in this folder are subsegments of the files in the '/WATS_USU' folder.
All of these files need to be described and catalogued, and comments added to each script.

## repeated_values.r
This script was used to help with quality control.  I used it to search our series of repeated values which could indicate sensor error.  I'm not sure if this is the final version or which sections of this script were ultimately used.

This script needs editing and attributions.
